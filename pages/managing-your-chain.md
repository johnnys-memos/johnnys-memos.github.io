# Managing Your Management Chain

---
---

_Originally written 11/30/2021_

## Background

At the beginning of the summer of 2021, my software engineering manager
left to join another team, and I spent that summer reporting into a senior
manager. Reporting into a senior manager was great because she didn't care
about the menial tasks that software engineers were typically expected to
handle; thus, I could spend all of my time focusing on high-level goals.
In fact, during that summer I completed a high-level goal and was able
to demo the finished product to my senior manager and our director. It
was a great feeling and it was great to get that type of recognition
from those leaders.

However, by the end of the summer of 2021, my senior manager had hired a
new software engineering manager, and I began reporting into that new
lower level manager. This new manager also started tracking metrics around
the menial tasks that software engineers were expected to handle, so I had
to adjust to these new job expectations.

Spending more time on the menial tasks would mean that I would have to
spend less time on the high-level goals; and thus, I would get less
recognition from the more senior leaders (senior managers and directors).
This document is intended to discuss how to balance serving different
managers in your management chain.

## Defintions

* __Direct manager__: The manager that you report directly into
* __Skip manager__: Your direct manager's direct manager
* __Management chain__: Every manager that is responsible for you. This
includes your direct manager, your skip manager, and every manager up to
and including the CEO


## Why even worry about managers in your chain other than your direct manager?

It may not be obvious to everyone that getting recognition from managers
further up your management chain is a perk - and it is definitely a perk.

At Amazon you cannot be promoted and you cannot be dismissed from the company
without your skip manager's approval. I think this is a good model for any
company because even though your direct manager should have the most say
in your promotion or your dismissal, someone should be responsible for
ensuring that your direct manager doesn't make a rash decision.

Furthermore, building rapport with managers further up your management chain
has its benefits as well. If you aim to one day move to a different area
of the company or organization and a manager within your chain overseas
that area, then having rapport with that manager could make your aims
more feasible or achievable. Also, if you aim to one day pitch an idea
for a new product or team and a manager in your chain needs to fund the
idea, then having rapport with that manager would have obvious benefits.


## Why worry about your direct manager?

At this point getting recognition from managers further up your management
chain is probably sounding pretty good. So why even bother with your
direct manager?

At Amazon your direct manager initiates the promotion process, and your
manager should also handle all of the heavy lifting of the promotion
process. At Amazon your manager also initiates and handles the dismissal
process - in other words, they can fire you as long as they have the
approval of your skip manager. At Amazon they can single-handedly prevent
you from moving to a different team within the company, and they have
nearly full discretion on the inputs that determine your total compensation.

I agree with Amazon's model. Your skip manager should have some checks
on your direct manager, but on the whole your direct manager should have
the most say on your employment status, title, and compensation. Thus,
it should be fairly obvious that your direct manager also matters and
in fact matters the most. If you're interested in remaining employed,
getting promoted, or getting paid more, then you must satisfy or impress
your direct manager.

Another important responsibility that your direct manager may have is
rating your performance. This rating is typically then sent a few
levels up the management chain. At Amazon your direct manager gives
you a rating, but it's unclear how high up the chain that rating goes
or how much of an impact it has on your relationship with your non-direct
managers. In an ideal world this rating would carry a lot of weight with
all of the managers in your management chain.


## Handling conflicting priorities within your chain

In a perfect world, each manager in your management chain would fully
and completely understand the priorities of their direct manager. Thus,
if you simply worked on what your direct manager asked for, then you
would also be satsifying the expectations of all of the managers further
up your chain. This would then lead to easy recognition from those higher
level managers in the future.

Unforunately, this type of scenario is difficult to achieve because
there's almost always some (even if slight) descrepancy in the
understanding of priorities. Understanding your manager's priorities
fully and completely can be one of the hardest parts of management.

Thus, if you find yourself in a scenario where your direct manager has
different priorities than your skip manager and if that discrepancy
is reasonably small, then don't fret this is normal. However, if that
discrepancy is unreasonably large, then your best option is to look
for a new team; otherwise, you can impress your direct manager but you
won't get proper recognition from your skip manager and managers further
up your chain.

Performance ratings can help with discrepancies within your management
chain because this rating indicates how well you are serving your direct
manager even if your direct manager isn't serving their manager
appropriately.

[//]: <> managers paid attention to, but it was good for us to get ideas

## Moving up the ladder

In the corporate world you're almost always going to have to focus on
moving up the ladder one rung at a time. This is because your direct
manager typically has so much power over your career trajectory.
Attempting to move up multiple rungs may mean that you have to disregard
duties that your direct manager expects from you, which means that you
may risk losing your job or you may risk receiving a poor performance
rating.

If your managers are good, then they will break down work into smaller
components and will distribute those components to the people that report
into them. More specifically, your direct manager will be on the hook
for completing certain goals, and your direct manager should break those
goals down into smaller components and assign a smaller component to you.
Thus, for the majority of the time you won't be able to deliver at the
same scope as your direct manager. However, there should still be
opportunities that come up on occasion for you to step up and deliver
at a larger scope than you typically do. For example, if your direct
manager abruptly leaves the team or takes an extended leave, then you may
have an opportunity to fill in for them and deliver at their level of
scope.


## Conclusion

Focus on serving your direct manager first, work for a direct manager that
fully and completely understands the priorities of their direct manager,
and wait patiently for opportunities to deliver at a larger scope than
is typically expected of your current role. Good companies and
organizations will be setup so that your direct manager is the most
important manager to serve in your management chain.
