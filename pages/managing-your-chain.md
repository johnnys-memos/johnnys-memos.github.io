# Managing Your Management Chain

---
---

_Originally written 11/30/2021_

## Background

At the beginning of the summer of 2021, my software engineering manager
left to join another team, and I spent that summer reporting into a senior
manager. Reporting into a senior manager was great because she didn't care
about the menial tasks that software engineers were typically expected to
handle; thus, I could spend all of my time focusing on high-level goals.
In fact, during that summer I completed a high-level goal and was able
to demo the finished product to my senior manager and our director. It
was a great feeling and it was great to get that type of recognition
from those leaders.

However, by the end of the summer of 2021, my senior manager had hired a
new software engineering manager, and I began reporting into that new
lower level manager. This new manager also started tracking metrics around
the menial tasks that software engineers were expected to handle, so I had
to adjust to these new job expectations.

Spending more time on the menial tasks would mean that I would have to
spend less time on the high-level goals; and thus, I would get less
recognition from the more senior leaders (senior managers and directors).
This document is intended to discuss how to satisfy and impress your direct
manager while also getting recognition from managers further up your
management chain.

## Defintions

* __Direct manager__: The manager you that report directly into
* __Skip manager__: Your direct manager's direct manager
* __Management chain__: Every manager that is responsible for you. This
includes your direct manager, your skip manager, and every manager up to
and including the CEO


## Why even worry about managers in your chain other than your direct manager?

It may not be obvious to everyone that getting recognition from managers
further up your management chain is a perk - and it is definitely a perk.

At Amazon you cannot be promoted and you cannot be dismissed from the company
without your skip manager's approval. I think this is a good model for any
company because even though your direct manager should have the most say
in your promotion or your dismissal, someone should be responsible for
ensuring that your direct manager doesn't make a rash decision.

Furthermore, building rapport with managers further up your management chain
has its benefits as well. If you aim to one day move to a different area
of the company or organization and a manager within your chain overseas
that area, then having rapport with that manager could make your aims
more feasible or achievable. Also, if you aim to one day pitch an idea
for a new product or team and a manager in your chain needs to fund the
idea, then having rapport with that manager would have obvious benefits.


## Why worry about your direct manager?

At this point getting recognition from managers further up your management
chain is probably sounding pretty good. So why even bother with your
direct manager?

At Amazon your direct manager initiates the promotion process, and your
manager should also handle all of the heavy lifting of the promotion
process. At Amazon your manager also initiates and managers the dismissal
process - in other words, they can fire you as long as they have the
approval of your skip manager. At Amazon they can single-handedly prevent
you from moving to a different team within the company, and they have
nearly full discretion on the inputs that determine your total compensation.

I agree with Amazon's model. Your skip manager should have some checks
on your direct manager, but on the whole your direct manager should have
the most say on your employment status, title, and compensation. Thus,
it should be fairly obvious that your direct manager also matters and
in fact matters the most. If you're interested in remaining employed,
getting promoted, or getting paid more, then you must satisfy or impress
your direct manager.

management chain


## Handling conflicting priorities within your chain

In a perfect world, each manager in your management chain would fully
and completely understand the priorities of their direct manager. Thus,
if you simply worked on what your direct manager asked for, then you
would also be satsifying the expectations of all of the managers further
up your chain. This would then lead to easy recognition from those higher
level managers in the future.

Unforunately, this type of scenario is difficult to achieve because
there's almost always some (even if slight) descrepancy in the
understanding of priorities. Understanding your manager's priorities
fully and completely can be one of the hardest parts of management.

Thus, if you find yourself in a scenario where your direct manager has
different priorities than your skip manager and if that discrepancy
is reasonably small, then don't fret this is normal. However, if that
discrepancy is unreasonably large, then your best option is to look
for a new team; otherwise, you can impress your direct manager but you
won't get recognition from your skip manager and managers further up
your chain.

## Moving up the ladder

- Focus on one rung at a time

- Your manager should breakdown work into smaller chunks and distribute
those chunks within the team. Thus, your overall contribution to a goal
should be smaller than if you had completed the entire goal yourself

- Wait for opportunities to step up and take on more scope

## Conclusion

- Work for your direct manager; otherwise, you're increasing the likelihood
that you get fired
