# Company Introductions

## Background

Introducing new hires via email is a great way to make people from across the
company or organization familiar with our new people. Introducing yourself
to a new team can be hard; and thus, I've written up some tips below to
help make your introduction a bit easier.

## Tips for New Hires

If I have asked or recommended that you to create an intro for yourself,
use the tips below as recommendations and not as hard requirements.
The goal of your intro is to accelerate the speed at which people in our
company or organization get to know you.

* Keep your intro to less than 100 words
* If you are moving from somewhere, mention where you are moving from
* Optionally, mention where your are from originally (born or raised)
* Mention what you were up to prior to joining your new team
* Optionally, mention one or two professional or academic accomplishments
* Spend the remainder and the majority of your intro focusing on your
interests and the things you like to do outside of work. The following
are some ideas:
  * What are your favorite types of movies?
  * What kind of restaurants or bars do you like?
  * Do you cook? If so, what kind of dishes do you like to cook?
  * Who would you most like to see live or in concert?
  * Do you play or watch any sports? If so, which ones?
And if you watch sports, which teams do you follow?
  * Do you play board games, video games, or other types of games?
If so, which are your favorites?
  * What are you favorite things to explore?

## Example Intro from Me in 2019

Hey everyone, I'm super excited to be returning to Amazon!
Before joining this team,
I was a software engineer for 2 years at a startup focusing on
online education. I'm originally from Indianapolis, and I travel back
every Memorial day weekend for the Indianapolis 500. Outside of work I
like to golf, play basketball, line dance, play board games and arcade
games, and go to concerts. I also like to explore Capitol Hill, and my
favorite bar is Still Liquor. I'm looking forward to the work ahead and
to meeting everyone on the team!
